## Problem 1: Create the Vectors

### (a) (1,2,3,...,19,20)
```{r}
seq(from=1, to=20)
```

### (b) (20,19,...,2,1)
```{r}
seq(from=20, to=1)
```

### (c) (1,2,3,...,19,20,19,18,...,2,1)
```{r}
c(1:20,19:1)
```

### (d) (4, 6, 3) and assign it to the name tmp.
```{r}
tmp <- c(4,6,3)
tmp
```

### (e) (4,6,3, 4,6,3,...,4,6,3) where there are 10 occurrences of 4.
```{r}
rep(tmp,times=10)
```

### (f) (4,6,3, 4,6,3,...,4,6,3,4) where there are 11 occurrences of 4, 10 occurrences of 6 and 10 occur- rences of 3.
```{r}
c(rep(tmp,length=31))
```

### (g) (4,4,...,4, 6,6,...,6, 3,3,...,3) where there are 10 occurrences of 4, 20 occurrences of 6 and 30 occurrences of 3.
```{r}
c(rep(tmp[1],times=10),rep(tmp[2],times=20),rep(tmp[3],times=30))
```

## Problem 2: Create a vector of the values of ex cos(x) at x = 3,3.1,3.2,...,
```{r}
x <- seq(from=3, to=6, by=0.1)
exp(x)*cos(x)
```
